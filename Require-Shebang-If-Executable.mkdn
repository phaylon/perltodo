## If you say we can execute it, give a shebang.

Well, at least if it's a shell script.

For example, `Porting/perlhist_calculate.pl` has no shebang, but is +x.
When I tried to run it, it complained.

This should be a porting test (in t/Porting) so that we can't screw this up
again.  Once that test works, *then* we should fix all the violations.
