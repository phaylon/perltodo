## Automate the "new modules" section

Each `perldelta` contains a section that lists what modules changed.  This
could be generated automatically by using Module::CoreList.

Look at `Porting/release_managers_guide.pod` for information on writing a
perldelta, as well as `Porting/perldelta_template.pod`
